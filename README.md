# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the branch of science that deals with the design, development and maintenance of software applications.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is based on designing, testing and maintenance of software and they are different because traditional programming is mainly based on coding.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
SDLC is a process used to design, build and maintain software.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
These are examples of agile SDLC: Backlog refinement, Sprint planning, Development, Testing and Review, Deployment, Retrospective while examples of Waterfall models are: Requirement gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The difference between Agile and Waterfall models is that Agile is iterative and flexible, while Waterfall is linear and sequential. Agile suits projects with changing requirements, while Waterfall fits those with clear, fixed specs.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering in software development is all about gathering, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. The process involves understanding what the users need from the system, documenting the needs, and ensuring they are clear, complete, and consistent.
Requirements engineering is crucial as it forms the foundation for the entire project. It helps in building the right software that meets the users' needs.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity in software design is defined as breaking down a software system into separate, independent modules or components. When it comes to maintainability, modularity helps by isolating changes to specific modules, making updates easier and less likely to impact other parts of the system and It also enhances scalability because new features can be added by simply adding new modules or modifying existing ones without affecting the entire system. While testing in software engineering, it's a crucial process that involves verifying and validating the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing focuses on testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure they work correctly, Integration testing checks if these units work together as expected, System testing evaluates the entire system's functionality, while acceptance testing ensures it meets the users' requirements.

Testing is crucial in software development because it helps in identifying and fixing issues early on, ensuring the software meets quality standards, functions correctly, and satisfies the users' needs which ultimately leads to a more reliable and successful software product.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
